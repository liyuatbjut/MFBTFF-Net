The references to the source data of this project, including the CELMS TB dataset and the information on in-situ measured samples, are in the "References_to_source_data" folder. 
The function of other files: 
【masksNormTBRegion.bmp】: masks of standard TB 
【GTpos.mat】: longitude and latitude of the in-situ measured samples
【mineralAbundNum.mat】:  ground truth oxide abundances of the in-situ measured samples (column: Al_2O_3, CaO, FeO, MgO, TiO_2, row: satellite missions)

The global lunar oxides maps generated by Chang'e-2 CELMS data in our work including Al_2O_3, CaO, FeO, MgO and TiO_2 are available from the first or the authors upon reasonable request for academic use by email. (yuli@bjut.edu.cn)
